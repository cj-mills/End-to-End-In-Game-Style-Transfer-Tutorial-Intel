**Note:** You might get an error like the one below in Unity, if you download the project from GitHub. 

`AssetImporter is referencing an asset from the previous import. This should not happen.`

You can fix this issue by rebuilding the Unit asset. 
1. Open the Kinematica folder in the Assets section. Double-click on the `Unit` asset.
2. Click `Build` in the pop-up window. You can close the pop-up window once the build is complete.
3. Back in the `Assets` section, open the `Biped` scene in the `Scenes` folder. 
The project should run normally now. However, there might be some stuttering the first time it is run.
